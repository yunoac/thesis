\section*{Conclusion}

In this chapter we provided a first formalization of segment routing that comprises both node and adjacency segments. 
We provided an algorithm for computing minimal segmentations. This algorithms opens the possibility of using traditional
graph algorithm for solving optimization problems over a network and then using it to segment and implement the solution on
a segment routed network. The advantage of this is that it allows to leverage the long lasting graph theory and
algorithms that have been developed without needing to extend those results to segment routing. The drawback of course
is that this approach yields no guarantees over the number of segments needed in the end. Maybe in the future, when the number
of segments in the segment stack becomes less of a limitation most solutions will eventually switch to this approach. However
for the time being, we still need solutions that take these constraints into account.

We also developed a reachability theory which constitutes the first steps towards having tools to analyze how well a network
is suited for segment routing. We will see in Chapter \ref{chapter:scmon} that this reachability theory makes it possible
to provide minimum segment cost cycle covers of a network in polynomial time.
