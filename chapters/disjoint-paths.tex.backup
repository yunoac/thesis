\chapter{Disjoint sr-paths}

Find disjoint paths in a graph is a very well estabilished problem.

In networking, it has several applications such has bla bla

In this chapter we study this problem of finding disjoint paths in a segment routing
setting.

\section{Disjoint sr-paths}

\begin{definition}
Two sr-path $p_1$ and $p_2$ are disjoint if and only if $\forw(p_1) \cap \forw(p_2) = \emptyset$.
\end{definition}
