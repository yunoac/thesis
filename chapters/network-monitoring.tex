\section*{Conclusion}

In this chapter we proposed a solution for identifying single-link failures in a network.
We showed that even if multiple failures occur, our algorithm can still identify a pair of 
edges $e$, $\rev(e)$ such that one of them is faulty with certainty.

Our experiments show that our algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time considering that
these cycles need to be installed only once in the network. 

Our solution works on the original topology and prides the theoretical minimum number of segments
required to implement any cycle cover using segment routing. This was achieved by using our reachability
theory developed in Chapter \ref{chapter:sr}. We also showed that if this segment cost
is too high, we can reduce it by working with a dual topology maxing the whole network monitoring 
process cost at most $9$ segments in the worst case, over all topologies from out dataset.

This was a second example where column generation provides good results when applied to solve an
segment routing optimization problem.
