 abstract = {Nowadays, the Internet delivers more than 1 zettabyte (or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes) of data to more than 3.2 billions of users every year. As a consequence, network operators face difficult challenges due to the impressive (and continuously growing) quantity of data to handle. Upgrading a network infrastructure with better hardware, to accommodate such a growth, has a significant cost (in terms of money and time) that network operators are trying to reduce by improving the efficiency (and thus the lifespan) of their network infrastructures. Traffic Engineering is a domain of networking that specifically aims at providing network operators with tools to optimize their networks. This thesis focuses on the problem of increasing the efficiency of a network by controlling the paths on which the traffic is sent using a new network framework called Segment Routing. In particular, we present various algorithms based on Mixed Integer Programming, Local Search, and Constraint Programming techniques to solve this traffic engineering problem on large networks like the ones of major Internet service providers.},

 abstract = {<p>In real-world problems related to finance, business, and management, mathematicians and economists frequently encounter optimization problems. In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered.</p><p>George Dantzig is properly acclaimed as the "father of linear programming." Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a situation. It can be used to minimize traffic congestion or to maximize the scheduling of airline flights. He formulated its basic theoretical model and discovered its underlying computational algorithm, the "simplex method," in a pathbreaking memorandum published by the United States Air Force in early 1948.<em>Linear Programming and Extensions</em>provides an extraordinary account of the subsequent development of his subject, including research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems.</p><p>Dantzig first achieved success as a statistics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. One day he arrived for a class after it had begun, and assumed the two problems on the board were assigned for homework. When he handed in the solutions, he apologized to his professor, Jerzy Neyman, for their being late but explained that he had found the problems harder than usual. About six weeks later, Neyman excitedly told Dantzig, "I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication." Dantzig had no idea what he was talking about. He later learned that the "homework" problems had in fact been two famous unsolved problems in statistics.</p>},

abstract="This paper describes the implementation of power series dual affine scaling variants of Karmarkar's algorithm for linear programming. Based on a continuous version of Karmarkar's algorithm, two variants resulting from first and second order approximations of the continuous trajectory are implemented and tested. Linear programs are expressed in an inequality form, which allows for the inexact computation of the algorithm's direction of improvement, resulting in a significant computational advantage. Implementation issues particular to this family of algorithms, such as treatment of dense columns, are discussed. The code is tested on several standard linear programming problems and compares favorably with the simplex codeMinos 4.0.",

abstract="We give a didactic introduction to the use of the column generation technique in linear and in particular in integer programming. We touch on both, the relevant basic theory and more advanced ideas which help in solving large scale practical problems. Our discussion includes embedding Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation within a branch-and-bound framework, deriving natural branching and cutting rules by means of a so-called compact formulation, and understanding and influencing the behavior of the dual variables during column generation. Most concepts are illustrated via a small example. We close with a discussion of the classical cutting stock problem and some suggestions for further reading.",

We present classes of models for which this approach decomposes the problem, provides tighter LP relaxations, and eliminates symmetry. We then discuss computational issues and implementation of column generation, branch-and-bound algorithms, including special branching rules and efficient ways to solve the LP relaxation. We also discuss the relationship with Lagrangian duality.},

abstract = "Results related to integer flows and cycle covers are presented. A cycle cover of a graph G is a collection C of cycles of G which covers all edges of G; C is called a cycle m-cover of G if each edge of G is covered exactly m times by the members of C. By using Seymour's nowhere-zero 6-flow theorem, we prove that every bridgeless graph has a cycle 6-cover associated to covering of the edges by 10 even subgraphs (an even graph is one in which each vertex is of even degree). This result together with the cycle 4-cover theorem implies that every bridgeless graph has a cycle m-cover for any even number m ≥ 4. We also prove that every graph with a nowhere-zero 4-flow has a cycle cover C such that the sum of lengths of the cycles in C is at most |E(G)| + |V(G)| − 2, unless G belongs to a very special class of graphs."
